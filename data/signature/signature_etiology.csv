"1","S4","0.282","Head and neck cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, oesophageal cancer","Associated with smoking and its profile is similar to the mutational pattern observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). S4 is likely due to tobacco mutagens","S29 is found in cancers associated with tobacco chewing and appears different from S4","Tobacco","default","Wangwei180608"
"2","S20","0.255","Stomach and breast cancers","S20 is believed to be associated with defective DNA mismatch repair","S20 is one of four mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is often found in the same samples as S6, S15, and S26","MMR","default","Wangwei180608"
"3","S18","0.251","Neuroblastoma (some breast and stomach)","Unknown","","Unknown","default","Wangwei180608"
"4","S24","0.212","A subset of liver cancers","S24 has been found in cancer samples with known exposures to aflatoxin. Additionally, the pattern of mutations exhibited by the signature is consistent with that previous observed in experimental systems exposed to aflatoxin","S24 exhibits a very strong transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair","Aflatoxin","default","Wangwei180608"
