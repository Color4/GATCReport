        "description": "ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1) is an ubiquitously expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase. In response to a variety of signals, ABL signaling can result in cell proliferation or differentiation, survival or death, and cell retraction or migration depending on the stimulus and target (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, DNA damage, and cellular kinases (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). Translocation between the BCR and ABL genes results in BCR-ABL, which is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL and instead, oligomerization leading to transphosphorylation and activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib have been developed and FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID:11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to select agents (PMID: 15256671).",

The catalytic activity of PDGFRA is mediated through the split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; PDGFRA binds to all PDGF ligand isoforms except PDGF-DD (PMID:18483217, 24703957). Mutations, insertions, deletions, fusions and genomic amplification of PDGFRA lead to its activation in several tumor types: ~7% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have PDGFRA activating mutations and these mutations are mutually exclusive from KIT mutations (PMID: 20023271); activating mutations in PDGFRA have been been reported in ~5% of Chinese melanoma patients (PMID:24132921); amplification of PDGFRA is the second most frequent receptor tyrosine kinase amplification in glioblastoma (GBM), is found in ~7-15% of GBM tumors and is often associated with in-frame deletions (PMID:18772890,19915670, 22323597, 20129251, 20889717); amplification of the PDGFRA locus has been reported in more than 80% of intimal sarcomas (PMID:20685895), ~19% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PMID:16357008), 3–7% of non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas and 8–10% non-small cell lung squamous cell carcinomas (PMID:19755855); activating mutations have been found in ~5% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and in ~14% of non-brain stem pediatric high-grade gliomas, around 40% of these occurring in the context of PDGFRA amplification (PMID:23970477); chimeric fusion transcripts to the catalytic domain of PDGFRA have been reported in select cases of GBM (PMID:20889717), chronic myeloid leukemia (PMID:12023981,12944919, 15034867) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) (PMID:12660384, 19187542, 16498388, 16845659, 17555450).

        "description": "KRAS is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Under physiologic conditions, these RAS proteins cycle between an active (GTP-bound) and an inactive (GDP-bound) state, to activate the MAPK and PI3K oncogenic pathway signaling downstream of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) (PMID: 22189424). The function of RAS enzymes is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as SOS, which enable the exchange of GDP to GTP, as well as by GTPase activating proteins, such as NF1, which increase the ability of RAS to hydrolyze GTP. Once activated, RAS mediates the regulation of cellular proliferation and other cellular functions through the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Transforming mutations in KRAS are frequently found in pancreatic, colon, endometrial, ovarian and biliary cancers; almost all of these mutations result in constitutive activation of KRAS, thereby promoting cell proliferation (PMID: 21993244, 24651010). KRAS mutations occur primarily in three major hotspots, G12, G13 and Q61, the first two of which occur in the GTP-ase domain and the latter interferes with the ability of NF1 to bind and regulate KRAS (PMID: 22589270, 21993244, 24651010). Other less well-characterized mutations such as A146T/V/P and L19F have also been characterized and found to be activating albeit at lower frequencies (PMID: 20147967, 20432530, 20570890).

The BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13q12-q13 (PMID: 8091231). The primary function of BRCA2 is in homologous recombination (HR). BRCA2 mediates recruitment of RAD51 to double-stranded DNA breaks; RAD51, in turn, allows for HR and the tumor suppressive function of the BRCA2-mediated DNA damage response (PMID: 11239455). The functionally significant regions of the BRCA2 gene are: the N terminus (amino acids 21-39), which binds directly to PALB2 and indirectly to BRCA1 and is crucial to the function of HR repair (PMID: 19369211, 19584259, 19268590, 19609323); the BRC repeats (amino acids 1009-2083), which bind to RAD51; the DNA binding domain, which facilitate binding to both DSS1 and single- and double-stranded DNA (PMID: 12228710, 16205630, 14580353, 20817001); and the C terminus consisting of a nuclear localization sequence and a CDK2 phosphorylation site at S3291 that also binds RAD51 (PMID: 15800615). BRCA2 mutations confer a 50-60% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 30% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a 20-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, a tenfold increased risk of pancreatic cancer, limited reports of related gastric cancer, and Fanconi anemia subtype D1-associated risk of brain cancer, medulloblastoma, pharyngeal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (reviewed in PMID: 22193408). Preclinical data for the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA2-deficient tumors showed that knock down of the BRCA2 gene in cell lines treated both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice resulted in exquisite sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors NU1025 and AG14361; conversely, knock in of BRCA2 in the mouse model resulted in resistance to AG14361 (PMID: 15829966). An accompanying article showed that PARP depletion, either by knock down with siRNA or treatment with PARP inhibitors, KU0058684 or KU0058948, in combination with deficiency in BRCA1 or BRCA2, was lethal to embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, this group was able to demonstrate that PARP inhibition was more selective in killing BRCA1or BRCA2-mutated cells than was the DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy agent cisplatin (PMID: 15829967).",

ERBB2/HER2 is unique in that it does not directly bind its own ligand. Instead, it potentiates the activity of other ligand-bound ERBB receptors such as EGFR (ERBB1) or ERBB3 by binding to them (PMID:12620236). Indeed, ERBB2 is the preferred binding partner for all ERBB receptor isoforms (PMID:10220407, 9130710) and ERBB2/ERBB3 complexes have shown high mitogenic activity through the activation of downstream oncogenic PI3K pathway (PMID: 12853564). Alternatively, ERBB2 may homodimerize and initiate intracellular mitogenic cascades including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SRC and STAT signaling pathways (PMID: 22785351). Approximately 17% to 30% of human breast tumors harbor ERBB2 gene amplification, which is associated with poor overall survival and time to tumor recurrence (PMID: 3798106, 23000897,9552035, 9469329). Amplified ERBB2 heterodimerizes with ERBB3 to activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and drive tumorigenesis in breast cancer (PMID:12853564, 23204226, 12124352, 18632642). ERBB2 is also amplified in about 20% of gastric or gastroesophageal cancers (PMID: 24943493, 21468131), and its overexpression is targeted by multiple available drugs (e.g., trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatanib, and pertuzumab) (PMID:24799465). There is a low incidence of ERBB2 amplification in non-small cell lung, ovarian, bladder, cervical, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic and salivary duct cancers and soft tissue sarcoma, and anecdotally in cholangiocarcinoma (reviewed in PMID: 24656976). Activating ERBB2 mutations have recently been identified at lower frequency in many cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, lobular breast, bladder, gastric and endometrial cancers, with recurrent hotspot alterations in both the extracellular and kinase domains (PMID: 23000897, 23220880, 22908275). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that many of these mutations are transforming and sensitive to FDA approved ERBB targeted therapies. Clinical trials are underway in ERBB2 mutant cohorts, with some positive evidence of the efficacy of ERBB2 targeted kinase inhibitors. ERBB2 mutations in colorectal cancer often co-occur with mutations in RAS.",

It has many cellular functions including transcription, protein ubiquitination, cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response, with a particularly important role in homologous recombination, a DNA double strand break repair pathway. BRCA1 was the first breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified and cloned; inherited mutations in this gene lead to an increased lifetime risk of developing these cancers. BRCA1 mutations confer a 70-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 50% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 founder mutations (PMID: 22193408). If one copy of BRCA1 is mutated in the germline, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (PMID: 22193408). BRCA1 was also recently identified as a definitive Fanconi anemia susceptibility gene in FANCS, a rare Fanconi anemia subtype that results from biallelic mutations in the gene (PMID: 25472942). BRCA1 has three major domains: the N-terminal RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain (exons 2-7) that contains an active zinc finger motif, exons 11-13, and the BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain. Many clinically significant mutations of BRCA1 are located in the zinc finger motif of the RING domain, which is important for many protein-protein interactions (PMID: 11573085). Exons 11-13 contain binding sites for proteins including RB, c-MYC, RAD50, and RAD51 (reviewed in PMID: 10918303). Despite the fact that exons 11-13 contain many clinically significant BRCA1 mutations, little is known about the structure or function of this region when compared to the RING or BRCT domains (PMID: 18273555). The BRCT domain is essential to the tumor suppressor function of the BRCA1 protein via its crucial role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (PMID: 11877378, 11118345). p53 mutations in breast tumors are seen almost exclusively with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting that p53 loss of function may be a necessary step in the tumorigenesis of BRCA-associated carcinomas (PMID: 14672397).",

Identified as a one of the two causative genes in tuberous sclerosis, much of what is known about the function of TSC1 has followed from investigation of its role in the development of hamartomas, which are multiple benign (and occasionally malignant) growths that characterize the disorder (PMID: 23485365, 9242607). TSC1 acts as a scaffold to form a heteromeric complex with TBC1D7 and TSC2 (tuberin), which functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits RHEB (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658). RHEB is a GTPase which functions as a small molecular switch, activating mTORC1 when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). The TSC complex associates with RHEB at the lysosomal membrane and is thought to be the main regulator of RHEB via its GAP activity, which results in conversion of the RHEB-bound GTP to GDP thereby preventing the ability of RHEB to activate mTORC1 (PMID: 24863881, 24529379, 14614311). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus integrating multiple pathways before providing regulatory inhibition to the mTOR pathway (PMID: 16959574). The mTOR pathway is upregulated in many, if not most, cancer types. Due to the central role of the mTOR pathway in cellular growth and regulation of protein synthesis, TSC1 inactivating mutations which result in a constitutively active mTORC1 complex have been theorized to result in cancer \"addiction\" to the mTOR pathway, thus indicating sensitivity to mTOR-inhibiting agents (rapamycin analogs) (PMID: 22923433). In fact, mutation in any of the TSC complex members results in loss of ability to regulate RHEB via dissociation of the TSC complex, loss of GAP activity and/or inability to localize the TSC complex to the lysosomal membrane (PMID: 24529379). TSC1 mutations, which are mostly truncating, frequently occur in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, melanoma, cancers of the uterus, bladder, and stomach, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with frequencies ranging from 1% to 10% (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2015).",

The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and transcription (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). As a component of a three-tiered MAPK cascade, MEK1 activity is dependent on phosphorylation by upstream RAF kinases. Activated MEK1 in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2) which then serves as a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 22177953). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). Dysregulation of MEK1 signaling is commonly associated with genetic alterations in RAS and RAF (PMID: 12068308, 12509763). Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers, such as melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers; however, oncogenic mutations in MEK1 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 22753777, 25351745).

ERα plays a major role in sexual reproductive development and maintenance, specifically in the female reproductive organs (PMID: 10368776). Binding of the hormone estrogen, the ERα ligand, induces conformational changes to ERα, which allows the receptor to dissociate from HSP90 and dimerize with itself or ERβ. The dimer then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoters and enhancers of target genes either directly, via Estrogen Responsive Elements (ERE) in the DNA, or via other transcription factor complexes such as FOS/JUN/SP-1 (PMID: 11162939, 10681512). Once bound, the estrogen receptor recruits co-regulators that modulate the transcription of ESR1 target genes, resulting in changes in proliferation, migration and differentiation (PMID: 21779010). Lack of ERα delays the development of WNT1- and ERBB2 mutant-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 10213494, 12019156) and reduces the occurrence of estrogen and carcinogen-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 20181624, 11156389), indicating the involvement of ERα in tumorigenesis. While mutations in ESR1 are generally very rare in primary cancers (<5%), a number of mutations occurring in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor were identified in ~12-25% of hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients (PMID: 24398047, 24185512, 24185510, 24217577).

Activated JAK2 signaling is necessary for the normal production of blood cells such as erythrocytes and thrombocytes (PMID: 9590173). Activation of JAK2 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3/5 and MAPK, enabling the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 25057888). Gain-of-function mutations in JAK2 have been identified in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, including 95% of polycythemia vera and 50% of essential thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis malignancies (PMID: 1583762, 23009934, 25629741), suggesting that JAK2 functions predominantly as an oncogene. JAK2 fusions and activating mutations have also been identified in various leukemias and lymphomas (PMID: 9360930, 18270328). The most commonly identified mutation is JAK2 V617F, an alteration that activates kinase activity by impairing the autoinhibitory domain of the kinase, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 17721432). Murine models engineered to express the JAK2 V617F mutation develop a myeloproliferative disorder (PMID: 28640953). While JAK2 mutations are rare in solid tumors, activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway has been found to be oncogenic in many tumor types (PMID: 26151455). The JAK2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib has been FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with high-risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera (PMID: 20843246). However, resistance to JAK2 inhibition has been found to occur via the formation of drug-resistant JAK1/JAK2 heterodimers (PMID: 22820254).

PTCH1 functions as the primary receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH), a secreted protein involved in embryonic development (PMID: 11001584, 8906787). In response to SHH, PTCH1 binds and inhibits Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor; this results in decreased signaling via the HH pathway (PMID: 14737121). Thus, PTCH1 functions as a classic tumor suppressor by inhibiting SMO-mediated oncogenic signaling.

The two best characterized downstream targets of mTORC1, S6K and 4EBP1, dictate the rate of protein synthesis, nutrient response and many additional features required for rapid tumor growth (PMID: 15314020). Consequently, inhibition of mTORC1 has been therapeutically exploited across a variety of malignancies. mTORC2 coordinates with PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate AKT. mTORC2 is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression and cellular survival (PMID: 18566586).

PTEN inactivation therefore promotes cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12040186). Additionally, nuclear PTEN is thought to regulate RAD51 expression, and in this way is also associated with homologous recombination and repair of DNA strand breaks (PMID: 17218262, 23888040). Thus, loss of PTEN may also lead to greater genomic instability and provide a setting for the accumulation of other deleterious mutations. PTEN is frequently mutated in many types of human cancers (PMID: 15254063). Germline loss-of-function PTEN mutations occur in approximately 80% of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome Cowden disease, which is associated with high-penetrance breast and thyroid cancer (PMID: 9467011, 24136893, 21430697).",

        "description": "EZH2 is the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2 requires other members of the PRC2 complex for full methyltransferase activity, including SUZ12 and EED (PMID: 15225548, 15916951), and PRC2 function is important in repression of developmental regulators such as the HOX genes, and X-inactivation (PMID: 16618801, 12649488). Additionally, non-coding RNA's can guide EZH2 to genomic targets for gene repression (PMID: 17604720, 22659877). EZH2 overexpression is found in many malignancies including lymphoma, bladder cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, and is associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis (PMID: 11389032, 16361539, 12374981, 14500907, 16330673, 24097870). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 occur frequently in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 20081860, 21190999). EZH2 can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cancer types, and recurrent inactivating mutations are observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (PMID: 20601953). Given its importance in multiple cancer types, EZH2 inhibition has shown promise in pre-clinical studies and is a current effort in multiple clinical trials, either through direct inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity or through disruption in PRC2 stability (PMID: 26845405).",
